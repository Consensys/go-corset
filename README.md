# Go Corset

The `go-corset` tool is a compiler for arithmetic constraints written
in a lisp-like [domain-specific
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language))
(called _Corset_).  The tool is specifically designed for used with
the [Linea constraint
system](https://github.com/Consensys/linea-constraints/) but could, in
principle, be used elsewhere.  The tool is based upon (but now
supercedes) the original Rust-based [`corset`
compiler](https://github.com/Consensys/corset) and
[language](https://github.com/Consensys/corset/wiki/The-Corset-Language).

## Overview

## Command-Line Interface

## Developer Setup

**Step 0.** Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

```shell
pip install pre-commit

# For macOS users.
brew install pre-commit
```

Then run `pre-commit install` to setup git hook scripts.
Used hooks can be found [here](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

______________________________________________________________________

NOTE

> `pre-commit` aids in running checks (end of file fixing,
> markdown linting, go linting, runs go tests, json validation, etc.)
> before you perform your git commits.

**Step 1.** Install external tooling (golangci-lint etc.):

```shell script
make install
```

**Step 2.** Setup project for local testing (code lint, runs tests, builds all needed binaries):

```shell script
make all
```

NOTE

> All binaries can be found in `<project_root>/bin` directory.
> Use `make clean` to delete old binaries.
>
> Check [Makefile](Makefile) for other useful commands.
