// Word abstracts the data type (a.k.a the "machine word") used for holding
// values within the machine.  The reason for abstracting this concept is to
// allow a machine compiled for a larger word size to be automatically lowered
// to a machine for a smaller word size.  For example, our source program might
// be written for a 64bit machine and we wish to executed it on 16bit machine
// (i.e. because our target field configuration has a maximum register size of
// 16bits).
