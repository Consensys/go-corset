// ReadOnly (ROM) represents a form of memory that can only be read during
// a given execution, but never written.  Thus, its contents are unchanged
// across a given execution.  ROMs can be static or dynamic.  The latter
// represents those which are fixed across all executions of a given machine,
// whilst the latter represent those which can change between different
// executions.  To understand this, consider the two ways in which ROMs are
// used: as inputs, and as static reference tables.  Dynamic ROMs correspond
// with inputs to the machine where, for example, we might want to execute the
// same program with different input data.  In constrast, static ROMs correspond
// to fixed tables used within the program (e.g. in a hash function such as
// BLAKE or KECCAK, there are fixed lookup tables used as part of the program).
