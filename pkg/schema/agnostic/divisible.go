// SubDivisible captures the notion of an entity (e.g. module, constraint or
// assignment) which is agnostic to the underlying field being used.  More
// specificially, any registers used within (and constraints, etc) can be
// subdivided as necessary to ensure a maximum bandwidth requirement is met.
// Here, bandwidth refers to the maximum number of data bits which can be stored
// in the underlying field. As a simple example, the prime field F_7 has a
// bandwidth of 2bits.  To target a specific prime field, two parameters are
// used: the maximum bandwidth (as determined by the prime); the maximum
// register width (which should be smaller than the bandwidth).  The maximum
// register width determines the maximum permitted width of any register after
// subdivision.  Since every register value will be stored as a field element,
// it follows that the maximum width cannot be greater than the bandwidth.
// However, in practice, we want it to be marginally less than the bandwidth to
// ensure there is some capacity for calculations involving registers.
type SubDivisible[T any] interface {
	// Subdivide for a given bandwidth and maximum register width. This will
	// split all registers wider than the maximum permitted width into two or
	// more "limbs" (i.e. subregisters which do not exceeded the permitted
	// width).  For example, consider a register "r" of width u32. Subdividing
	// this register into registers of at most 8bits will result in four limbs:
	// r'0, r'1, r'2 and r'3 where (by convention) r'0 is the least significant.
	//
	// As part of the subdivision process, constraints may also need to be
	// divided when they exceed the maximum permitted bandwidth.  For example,
	// consider a simple constraint such as "x = y + 1" using 16bit registers
	// x,y.  Subdividing for a bandwidth of 10bits and a maximum register width
	// of 8bits means splitting each register into two limbs, and transforming
	// our constraint into:
	//
	// 256*x'1 + x'0 = 256*y'1 + y'0 + 1
	//
	// However, as it stands, this constraint exceeds our bandwidth requirement
	// since it requires at least 17bits of information to safely evaluate each
	// side.  Thus, the constraint itself must be subdivided into two parts:
	//
	// 256*c + x'0 = y'0 + 1  // lower
	//
	//         x'1 = y'1 + c  // upper
	//
	// Here, c is a 1bit register introduced as part of the transformation to
	// act as a "carry" between the two constraints.
