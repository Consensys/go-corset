// DefConstraint represents a vanishing constraint, which is either "local" or

// its expression must evaluate to zero for the rows on which it is active.  A
// constraint may also have a "guard" which is an expression that must evaluate
// to a non-zero value for the constraint to be considered active.  The
// expression for a constraint must have a single context.  That is, it can only
// be applied to columns within the same module (i.e. to ensure they have the
// same height).  Furthermore, within a given module, we require that all
// columns accessed by the constraint have the same length multiplier.

// DefLookup represents a lookup constraint between a set N of source
// expressions and a set of N target expressions.  The source expressions must
// have a single context (i.e. all be in the same module) and likewise for the
// target expressions (though the source and target contexts can differ).  The
// constraint can be viewed as a "subset constraint".  Let the set of "source
// tuples" be those obtained by evaluating the source expressions over all rows
// in the source context, and likewise the "target tuples" those for the target
// expressions in the target context.  Then the lookup constraint holds if the
// set of source tuples is a subset of the target tuples.  This does not need to
// be a strict subset, so the two sets can be identical.  Furthermore, these are
// not treated as multi-sets, hence the number of occurrences of a given tuple
// is not relevant.

// DefFun represents defines a (possibly pure) "function" (which, in actuality,

// is encountered we can imagine that, in the final constraint set, the body of
// the function is inlined at the point of the call.  A pure function is not
// permitted to access any columns in scope (i.e. it can only manipulate its
// parameters).  In contrast, an impure function can access those columns
// defined within its enclosing context.
type DefFun struct {

// Expr represents an arbitrary expression over the columns of a given context
// (or the parameters of an enclosing function).  Such expressions are pitched
// at a higher-level than those of the underlying constraint system.  For
// example, they can contain conditionals (i.e. if expressions) and
// normalisations, etc.  During the lowering process down to the underlying
// constraints level (AIR), such expressions are "compiled out" using various
// techniques (such as introducing computed columns where necessary).
