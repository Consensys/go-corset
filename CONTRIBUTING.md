### Minor Issues

Unfortunately, we do not accept non-code contributions like fixing
comments, typos or some other trivial fixes. Although we appreciate
the extra help, managing lots of these small contributions is
unfeasible, and puts extra pressure in our continuous delivery systems
(running all tests, etc).
