;; Replace n bytes starting from a specific offset in the given word
;; with a given value.  For example, consider this word:
;;
;; 0xffeeddccbbaa99887766554433221100
;;
;; Filling 3 bytes of this word with 0s starting at offset 2 gives the
;; following:
;;
;; 0xffeeddccbbaa99887766550000001100
;;                         <---^^
;;
;; Here, we see the cursor starts at offset 2 and keeps going until
;; n==0.  The key is that all other bytes remain unchanged.  Note, the
;; cursor wraps around to the beginning upon overflow.
